This repository contains code for reading and analyzing MRI data using Python. The code reads in MRI images in the NIfTI format and applies various image processing techniques to analyze the images.

# Introduction
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that is commonly used in medical diagnosis. MRI images are stored in the NIfTI format, which is a standard format for medical imaging data.

This project aims to read in MRI images in the NIfTI format and apply various image processing techniques to analyze the images. The project uses the Python programming language and several Python libraries for image processing and visualization.
The project uses the following technologies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- nibabel
